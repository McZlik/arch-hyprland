# Arch Hyprland
McZlik's custom install scripts to automate the installating of hyprland on arch based systems

First setup based on [ML4W's hyprland-starter](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/hyprland-starter)

## Todo
- Find a way to install and enable gnome keyring, probably hard :c
- Remove dotfiles from this repository and move them back to their own repository
- Check if we can preset the gtk theme after installing everything
- Actually enable servies we install
