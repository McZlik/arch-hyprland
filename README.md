# Arch Hyprland
McZlik's custom install scripts to automate the installating of hyprland on arch based systems

## Inspiration
First setup based on [ML4W's hyprland-starter](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/hyprland-starter/tree/1.0.1)





## Installation
Just copy the following command into your terminal and execute.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hyprland does not officially support NVIDIA hardware. But many users have reported a successful installation. Please read: https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nvidia/

``` bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/McZlik/arch-hyprland/refs/heads/feature/first-setup/setup.sh)
```

## Packages
## Key Bindings

## Todo
- Find a way to install and enable gnome keyring, probably hard :c
- Remove dotfiles from this repository and move them back to their own repository
- Check if we can preset the gtk theme after installing everything
- Actually enable services we install
- Create docs for key bindings
- Expand docs in general
